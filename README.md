# PicoMusic
Music generation and spectrum visualization on RP2040 with [CMSIS-Stream](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Stream) and [CMSIS-DSP](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP).

## Introduction

The demo is made of 2 CMSIS-Stream graphs. Core0 is running an audio graph.

Core1 is running an LCD graph.

The audio graph is synthesizing the sound and sending it to the PWM driver and Core 1.

The LCD graph is reading the audio data and generating a framebuffer to display a spectrum, amplitude and texture background (with some animation and blending).

[Arm-2D](https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D) is not yet integrated.

The transistor is a NPN 2222A

Speaker has a resistance of 4 Î©

The LCD is https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-1.3

And we are using a https://www.waveshare.com/pico-quad-expander.htm to connect the LCD



## How to build

First, you need to be able to build the Pico examples and have the pico-extra since the demo is using audio drivers from pico-extra. Refer to the Pico documentation to know what to install.

```shell
mkdir build.tmp
cd build.tmp
cmake -DDSP=/root/CMSIS-DSP \
  -DSTREAM=/root/CMSIS-Stream \
  -DCMSISCORE=/root/CMSIS_5/CMSIS/Core \
  ..
make
```

Where `root` is the path where you have installed the CMSIS libraries.

You can clone the CMSIS libraries with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP.git
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Stream.git
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5.git
```

# PicoMusic
Music generation and spectrum visualization on RP2040 with [CMSIS-Stream](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Stream) and [CMSIS-DSP](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP).

## Introduction

The demo is made of 2 CMSIS-Stream graphs. Core0 is running an audio graph.

Core1 is running an LCD graph.

The audio graph is synthesizing the sound and sending it to the PWM driver and Core 1.

The LCD graph is reading the audio data and generating a framebuffer to display a spectrum, amplitude and texture background (with some animation and blending).

[Arm-2D](https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D) is used to compose the UI and generate the content of the layers.

## Audio graph

The song used for this example has only 6 channels so we have used 6 in the graph. But it is configurable in the Python and can have as many channels as needed.

When a channel is not used by a song it has a low overhead (but memory copies are still occuring because buffers can be shared between different "FIFOs" for memory optimization purposes).

## LCD Graph

Widgets are drawing into a layer using some Arm-2D functions.

The layers are then composed by the Arm-2D node to render the final screen on the LCD.

Signal is decimated because we only have 240 samples to display and also to avoid having a too high refresh rate.

## Connection to speaker

The transistor is a NPN 2222A

Speaker has a resistance of 4 Î©

And we are using a https://www.waveshare.com/pico-quad-expander.htm to connect the LCD



## How to build

First, you need to be able to build the Pico examples and have the pico-extra since the demo is using audio drivers from pico-extra. Refer to the Pico documentation to know what to install.

```shell
mkdir build.tmp
cd build.tmp
cmake -DARM2D=/ArmSoftware/Arm-2D \
 -DCMSISDSP=/ArmSoftware/CMSIS-DSP \
 -DCMSISSTREAM=/ArmSoftware/CMSIS-Stream \
 -DCMSISCORE=/ArmSoftware/CMSIS_5/CMSIS/Core \
 -DARM2D_RP2040=/ArmSoftware/Arm2D_RP2040/RP2040 \
 -DHOST=NO ..
make
```

Where `ArmSoftware` is the path where you have installed the Arm libraries.

You can clone the Arm libraries with:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP.git
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-Stream.git
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5.git
git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D.git
git clone https://github.com/christophe0606/Arm2D_RP2040
```

The last project is providing RP2040 specific optimizations for Arm-2D and is also providing a CMakeLists.txt to make it easier to build Arm-2D + CMSIS-DSP in the Pico environment.
